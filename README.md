    
OSE Computing Primer
====================

by [Gregor Boehl](gregorboehl.com).

This course is a generic introduction to (scientific) programming in economics, covering the essentials: 

    * variables
    * loops
    * conditionals
    * functions
    * basics of data analysis
    * plotting
    * perspectives (performance, parallelization, ...)
    * ...

The examples cover Python code, a cheat sheet for R code will be provided.
